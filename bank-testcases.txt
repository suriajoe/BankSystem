test0: basic account mechanics

//intital connection
client side: prints "Hello!"
server prints "Please enter command
server side: Waiting for new connection
             Found new connection 

every 20 second the server will STDOUT
and print the status, account name, account balance, and IN session
for all open accounts and in session accounts

if server is not active then client will keep searching for connection and print
searching for remote connection   every 3 seconds

client side:  open/account "name" 
client prints: successfully opened account
server prints initial values 

client side:  close session, and exit socket connection
 server prints exit messages 

client side:  add acount Joe  (again even though this account exists)
client prints: "Account already exists, please try again"

client side: start the account session 
server prints: Session started...

client side: credit 200
server prints: Funds added to account

client side: debit 200
server prints: Funds deducted from account

client side: balance 
server prints: Current balance 100.00  
server retains all balance information even sessions close
and even if clients disconnect

client side: finish 
client prints: Ending session
server prints: Bank Status
               Account #0
               Account holder: Joe
               balance: 100.00

client side: exit
server prints: Thank you!
               END

client side: open kevin
client prints:sucessfully opened account
server prints:
             Account #1: 
             Account holder: kevin
             balance: 0.00

client side: enters an invalid command
server prints: prints the status of all accounts
client side: Invalid command, please try again

server will not allow client to open a session of an
already IN SESSION account

server will not allow to start a session if the account was not open

close session in first client, but keep client shell open
and then try to open account in second, server will allow this

open new client shell and try to open same account, server will say no
